The upstream tarball for this application has been altered to remove 
(unneeded) binary-only components. The list of files removed is as follows:

      src/addins/NUnit/lib/nunit.framework.dll
      src/addins/NUnit/lib/nunit.core.dll
      src/addins/NUnit/lib/nunit.util.dll
      src/addins/NUnit/lib/nunit.core.interfaces.dll

To create your own copy of this modified tarball, use the "get-orig-source" 
rule in the debian/rules makefile.

monodevelop (0.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mono BSP
  * Mirco 'meebey' Bauer
    + added pkg-config dependency (Closes: #262491)
    + added 01_spawn_xterm_fix patch
      upstream depends stricly on xterm to execute the programs compiled with
      monodevelop. The command uses xterm -e and run a shell "read" at the
      end. This doesn't work with other x-terminal-emulators, they don't spawn
      a shell for the command. x-terminal-emulator -e with -c fixes this.
      (Closes: #260404)

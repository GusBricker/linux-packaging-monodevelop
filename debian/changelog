    + Upstream split MonoDevelop into 4 tarballs:
      - monodevelop
      - monodevelop-boo
      - monodevelop-database
      - monodevelop-java
      thus we split up the monodevelop source package into 4 pieces too.
    + MonoDevelop doesn't crash anymore on startup if TMPDIR points to an
      invalid directory. (Closes: #455822)
  * debian/NEWS:

      Those libraries are used now by the other monodevelop source packages.
    + Added libgtkspell-dev and libmono-winforms2.0-cil to build-dependencies.
    + Changed mono-xsp(2) build dependencies to mono-xsp(2)-base, as those are
      sufficient to build the package. (Closes: #447342)

      must be present.
  * debian/patches/fix_dllmaps.dpatch:
    + Dropped, upstream doesn't ship a dllmap anymore, thus we need to provide
      it completly.
  * debian/MonoDevelop.Gettext.dll.config

monodevelop (0.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mono BSP
  * Mirco 'meebey' Bauer
    + added pkg-config dependency (Closes: #262491)
    + added 01_spawn_xterm_fix patch
      upstream depends stricly on xterm to execute the programs compiled with
      monodevelop. The command uses xterm -e and run a shell "read" at the
      end. This doesn't work with other x-terminal-emulators, they don't spawn
      a shell for the command. x-terminal-emulator -e with -c fixes this.
      (Closes: #260404)

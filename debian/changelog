monodevelop (0.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

   * Created 01_fix_startup_script.dpatch to fix bashism (Closes: #311672).
   * Enabled Boo and Java support (Closes: #311730).
   * Created monodevelop-boo and monodevelop-java package.
     (building monodevelop-java package is disabled though, the integration
      is currently buggy in 0.7)
   * debian/NEWS:
     + Updated for 0.4 -> 0.7 problems/news, please read!
   * debian/control:
     + Removed libmono-dev, libglade2-dev, libgnome2-dev, libgtksourceview-dev,
       libgnomevfs2-dev and liborbit2-dev from build-deps. They are not
       required anymore because monodevelop uses the C# bindings now.
     + Removed "Uploaders" field, it's optional.
     + Added boo and ikvm to build-deps.
     + Added ${misc:Depends} to "Depends".
   * debian/rules:
     + Added --enable-boo and --enable-ikvm to configure call.
     + Added dh_installmime and dh_desktop call.
     + Removed all "-i" from dh_* calls, whole package is arch indep.

monodevelop (0.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mono BSP
  * Mirco 'meebey' Bauer
    + added pkg-config dependency (Closes: #262491)
    + added 01_spawn_xterm_fix patch
      upstream depends stricly on xterm to execute the programs compiled with
      monodevelop. The command uses xterm -e and run a shell "read" at the
      end. This doesn't work with other x-terminal-emulators, they don't spawn
      a shell for the command. x-terminal-emulator -e with -c fixes this.
      (Closes: #260404)

monodevelop (0.18.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrading MonoDevelop 0.14 to 0.18.1 is not updating the addins database
    correctly resulting in a crash with the folling console output:

    Add-in error (MonoDevelop.Core,0.18.0): Add-in could not be loaded: Could
    not read add-in file: $HOME/.config/MonoDevelop/addin-db-001/addin-data/1/
    MonoDevelop.Core,0.18.0.maddin
    ...
    Unhandled Exception: System.InvalidOperationException: Could not read
    add-in description

    You can fix this issue by running (at least that worked for me):
    mdtool setup reg-build

    If you are still getting that InvalidOperationException, then you can try
    to delete the addin database (monodevelop will rebuild it then) using:
    rm -r ~/.config/MonoDevelop/addin-db-*/

monodevelop (0.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The 0.7 release of MonoDevelop has some major changes:
  * MonoDevelop uses now a different project file format (.mdp instead of
    .cmbx), it will convert your old project files automatic when you open them.
  * It uses Gtk#2 (1.9.x) now, means you can also develop Gtk#2 projects now.
    But Gtk#1 projects will _not_ work anymore, problem is that Gtk#2 (by
    MonoDevelop) and Gtk#1 (by your project) can't be loaded at the same time!
    If you try this, MonoDevelop will just crash, so please update your project
    to use Gtk#2.
  * The source code of MonoDevelop is 100% C# now, means the package will
    now run on all Mono architectures (x86, ppc, amd64).
  * The configuration files of MonoDevelop are not backwards compatible, it
    may happen that MonoDevelop just crashes on starup! Please delete
    ~/.config/MonoDevelop if that happens and try again.

monodevelop (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * this release of MonoDevelop has a new code completion database, and it
    breaks old project files.
    To fix this read the following release notes:
    ...
    In order to work properly with the GAC, when loading an old project for
    the first time under MonoDevelop 0.4, you will have to remove and readd
    all of your references. Until you do so, many pieces of MonoDevelop wil
    not function correctly.
    ...
  * Full release notes: http://www.monodevelop.com/release_notes/0.4.html
  * there is a known problem with MonoDevelop 0.4:
    MonoDevelop crashes when the GUI appears, shortly after the splash screen
    on startup. The problem is most likely caused by a window manager that
    confuses Gdk (eg. IceWM). The problem needs further investigation.
